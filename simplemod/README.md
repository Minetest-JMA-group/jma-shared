# simplemod – Simple Moderation for Minetest

simplemod provides name‑based and IP‑based bans and mutes for Minetest, leveraging the `ipdb` mod for reliable IP tracking and the `algorithms` mod for time utilities. It includes a clean API, chat commands, and a GUI.

## Features

- **Name‑based bans/mutes** – stored in dedicated synthetic `ipdb` modstorage entries.
- **IP‑based bans/mutes** – stored in `ipdb` per‑entry storage, automatically merged when IP‑linked accounts are merged.
- **Per‑player logs** – combined log of name and IP actions (ban/unban/mute/unmute), capped at the newest 100 entries per scope.
- **Active lists** – commands to list all currently banned or muted players (name + IP).
- **Chat commands** – full set of commands usable from Discord/relays or in‑game.
- **GUI** – four‑tab interface: Active Bans, Active Mutes, Player Log, and Actions (for applying new actions).
- **API** – other mods can call `simplemod.ban_name()`, `simplemod.is_muted_ip()`, etc.
- **Relay support** – optionally sends action reports to `relays` mod.
- **Discord mute‑log** – optionally forwards muted chat to a Discord channel via `discordmt`.

## Dependencies

- `algorithms` – for time parsing/formatting.
- `ipdb` – required for both IP and name backends (trusted internal API + per-entry storage + merges).
- `chat_lib` – for sending muted messages to privileged players.
- `relays` – for external notifications.
- `discordmt` (optional) – for forwarding muted chat to a Discord mute-log channel.

All dependencies are part of the same modpack and must be enabled.

## Chat Commands

All commands require `ban` privilege (for bans) or `pmute` privilege (for mutes).

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/sbban <player_or_ip> <name\|ip> [--new] [time] <reason>` | Ban by name or IP |
| `/sbunban <player_or_ip> <name\|ip> [reason]` | Unban by name or IP |
| `/sbmute <player_or_ip> <name\|ip> [--new] [time] <reason>` | Mute by name or IP |
| `/sbunmute <player_or_ip> <name\|ip> [reason]` | Unmute by name or IP |
| `/sbbanlist` | List all active bans (name + IP) |
| `/sbmutelist` | List all active mutes (name + IP) |
| `/sblog <player>` | Show combined log for a player |
| `/smca <player> <on\|off>` | Allow or block muted player's access to moderator mute-log chat |
| `/sb` | Open the GUI |

Time format examples: `30m`, `2h`, `1d`, `2w`, `3M` (month = 30 days). If omitted, the punishment is permanent.

## GUI

Opened with `/sb`. Four tabs:

- **Active Bans** – lists all name and IP bans.
- **Active Mutes** – lists all name and IP mutes.
- **Player Log** – enter a name and click "View Log" to see that player's combined history.
- **Actions** – perform bans/unbans/mutes/unmutes with reason templates (spam, grief, hack, language, custom). Fields can be prefilled by selecting an entry in the first two tabs and clicking "Open In Actions".  
  For IP scope, you can also enter raw IPv4 targets, and the `Ban/Mute unknown` checkbox will auto-register unknown targets in `ipdb` before ban/mute.

## API

```lua
-- Name bans
simplemod.ban_name(target, source, reason, duration_sec)  → success, err
simplemod.unban_name(target, source, reason)              → success, err
simplemod.is_banned_name(target)                           → boolean

-- Name mutes
simplemod.mute_name(target, source, reason, duration_sec) → success, err
simplemod.unmute_name(target, source, reason)              → success, err
simplemod.is_muted_name(target)                             → boolean

-- IP bans
simplemod.ban_ip(target, source, reason, duration_sec)    → success, err
simplemod.unban_ip(target, source, reason)                 → success, err
simplemod.is_banned_ip(target)                              → boolean

-- IP mutes
simplemod.mute_ip(target, source, reason, duration_sec)   → success, err
simplemod.unmute_ip(target, source, reason)                → success, err
simplemod.is_muted_ip(target)                               → boolean

-- Combined log for a player (table of entries, newest first)
simplemod.get_player_log(player) → { {type, scope, target, source, reason, duration, time}, ... }
```

- `target` – player name (string)
- `source` – moderator name or `"(console)"` (string)
- `reason` – optional reason (string)
- `duration_sec` – seconds, `0` or `nil` = permanent

## Storage Details

- **Name bans/mutes** – stored as one row per target in synthetic `ipdb` modstorage entries (`key = playername`, `auxiliary = expiry`).
- **Name logs** – stored as one row per action in synthetic `ipdb` modstorage (`key = playername`, multimap; `auxiliary = event time`).
- **IP bans/mutes** – stored in `ipdb` per‑entry storage under keys `"ban"` and `"mute"` with `auxiliary = expiry` when applicable.
- **IP logs** – stored as multimap rows in `ipdb` per‑entry storage under key `"log"` (`auxiliary = event time`).
